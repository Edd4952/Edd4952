I have experience in Java, Javascript, CSS, some HTML, some python.

I made a short 2d game in Gamemaker studio but i cant upload it onto newgrounds bc its not html5 and i dont want to pay for that :(
Im working on web development stuff right now. Basically learning to code in scripting languages and eventually make a website and hopefully a website business.
